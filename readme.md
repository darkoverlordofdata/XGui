# XGui

A prototypal X11 based gui lib in objc

The main purpose of this is to create a modular gui for [kitty-cat-lock](https://github.com/darkoverlordofdata/kitty-cat-lock.git).  Its difficult to navigate code in plain old c, my lock screen has pushed my abilities to keep track of code - what did I do back in the 80's?
